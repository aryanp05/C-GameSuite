## Games

### Hangman

A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

**Rules:**

- Players guess one letter at a time.
- If a guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position.
- Players can attempt to guess the entire word.
- Players lose if they exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses.

### 21 Cards

A card game where players try to get as close to 21 points without exceeding it. Players are dealt cards and can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep their current total).

**Rules:**

- Cards have point values: numbered cards are worth their number, face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth 1 or 11.
- Players can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stand" to end their turn.
- The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over.

### Dice Game

A betting game where players roll two dice and bet points on the outcome being even or odd. Players can double their bet if they win.

**Rules:**

- Players start with 1000 points.
- Players bet points on whether the sum of two rolled dice will be even or odd.
- If the sum matches the bet, players win double their bet; otherwise, they lose the bet.
- The game ends when players choose to exit or run out of points.

### Quick Maths

A math challenge game where players solve addition, subtraction, or multiplication problems within three attempts.

**Rules:**

- Players choose a type of math problem: addition, subtraction, or multiplication.
- Players solve 10 problems of the chosen type.
- Points are awarded based on the number of attempts taken to solve each problem.
- The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
